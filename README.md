# IMDb Score Analysis â€“ Strategic Recommendation

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes the key factors that influence IMDb scores for movies and TV shows.  
By examining genre, production country, runtime, and release year, the goal is to provide actionable recommendations for content strategy on streaming platforms.

---

##  Key Findings
- **Genre**: The strongest predictor of IMDb score.  
   Recommended genres: **Documentary, Drama, Crime** â€“ significantly higher average scores.  

- **Country of Production**: Strong impact on average ratings.  
   Recommended countries: **South Korea, Japan, United Kingdom** â€“ consistently higher scores.  

- **Runtime & Release Year**:  
  - Shorter films and those released before 2010 have slightly higher ratings.  
  - However, the effect is weaker compared to **genre** and **country**.  

---

##  Strategic Recommendation
To maximize success and visibility on streaming platforms:  
 Prioritize **production and acquisition** of **Documentary, Drama, and Crime** films,  
 Focus on content from **South Korea, Japan, and the UK**.  

This direction is supported both by predictive modeling and real IMDb score distributions.
